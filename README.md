#~/dotfiles

Here I store all my dotfiles, so may others will judge me or call me a n00b.

Help and improvments always appreciated.

### Usage

How I am using and storing files at the moment. "Simply" symlinkin' the files to
the home directory.

```sh
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:kevingimbel/dotfiles.git
$ ln -s dotfiles/.zshrc .
```
